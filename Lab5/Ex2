the function will be created that receive the word:
    An if statement will be generated to house the base case which will be zero
    An elif statement will be produced with conditions as follows:
        if the first index is not equal to the last index
            it will return false/the word is not palindrome
    if the conditions in the elif statement are not met, the function will call
    itself until the bace case condition is met, which will then return true/the word is palindrome
